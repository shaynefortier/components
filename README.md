# My components

I build a series of components with vanilla JavaScript for my projects. I build the HTML structure with the CSS classes defined for each components that I can simply copy, then instanciate the JavaScript classes to the targeted elements like magic.

I try to keep up to date and modify the components when there is a native API. I try to limit the use of libraries to keep the code base simple and lightweight.
