# My components

I build a series of components with vanilla JavaScript for my projects. I build the HTML structure with the CSS classes defined for each components that I can simply copy, then instanciate the JavaScript classes to the targeted elements like magic.

I try to keep up to date and modify the components when there is a native API. I try to limit the use of libraries to keep the code base simple and lightweight.

I also seek to publish the components that have certain level of accessibility. Here is what my standard:

1. The user can see the content even if JavaScript is deactivated.
2. Have easy navigation using only the keyboard.
3. Not my absolute priority, but add aria attributes when absolutely needed.
